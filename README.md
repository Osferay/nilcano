==================================

by Óscar Fernández Ayala <oscar00ayala@gmail.com>



About
-----

The nilcano package provides methods to compute the canonical conjugacy representatives of elements and subgroups of nilpotent groups given by a polycyclic presentation, compute the intersection of two subgroups of a nilpotent subgroup and computing the product of two subgroups of a nilpotent group.

This package requires GAP version 4.13 or later and Polycyclic package version 2.16 or later.



Installation
------------

Either place the folder in the pkg subdirectory of your gap folder, or in any other folder where you have write permission. You can verify if GAP recognizes the nilcano package using the following command:

    gap> LoadPackage("nilcano");
